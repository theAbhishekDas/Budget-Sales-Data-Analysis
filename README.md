The objective of this project is to analyze sales budget data to gain insights into the performance of the company. This involves conducting Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes on the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. Key tasks include extracting information such as sales, budget, and variance, as well as identifying essential details about products and customers. By synthesizing this information, the project aims to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides a visual representation of the company's performance metrics. Additionally, the project seeks to identify key metrics and factors influencing sales performance, facilitating a deeper understanding of the meaningful relationships between various attributes to inform strategic decision-making processes.
